    tomoRecon Release Notes</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-2 (March 11, 2013)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added libfftw3f.a in tomoReconApp/src/os/linux-x86 and linux-x86_64 to the SVN
      repository and source code distribution. Previous source-code releases were missing
      these files, so it would not build.</li>
    <li>Modified tomoReconApp/src/Makefile to show how to build with the system version
      of libfftw3f if that is desired.</li>
    <li>Minor change to IDL/tomo_recon.pro so that it will compile with GDL (GNU Data
      Language) as well as IDL.</li>
    <li>Tested the IDL/tests programs with GDL, and they work, including the netCDF and
      call_external code. This is good news, since it means that an IDL license is not
      needed to use the tomo_recon.pro front-end to tomoRecon.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-1 (March 7, 2013)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Improvements to the Linux pre-built version
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the Makefile so it links with the static version of the libCom library.
          This means that libtomoRecon.so no longer depends on libCom.so. Previously libCom.so
          needed to be available at run-time.</li>
        <li>Changed the Makefile so it links with the static version of the libfftw3f library.
          This means that libtomorecon.so no longer depends on libfftw3f.so. Previously libfftw3f.so
          needed to be available at run-time.</li>
        <li>Added 2 new architectures, linux-x86-gcc43 and linux-x86_64-gcc42. The linux-x86_64
          architecture is built using gcc 4.6.3. It will not run on systems with older versions
          of gcc because of incompatible changes to the GCC and C run-time libraries. linux-x86-gcc43
          was built with gcc 4.3.0, and linux-x86_64-gcc42 was built with gcc 4.2.1. These
          builds will run on older Linux systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-0 (August 17, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>First release.</li>
  </ul>
