    tomoRecon Release Notes</h1>

    Release 1-1 (September XXX, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Improvements to the Linux pre-built version
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the Makefile so it links with the static version of the libCom library.
          This means that libtomoRecon.so no longer depends on libCom.so. Previously libCom.so
          needed to be available at run-time.</li>
        <li>Changed the Makefile so it links with the static version of the libfftw3f library.
          This means that libtomorecon.so no longer depends on libfftw3f.so. Previously libfftw3f.so
          needed to be available at run-time.</li>
        <li>Added 2 new architectures, linux-x86-gcc43 and linux-x86_64-gcc42. The linux-x86_64
          architecture is built using gcc 4.6.3. It will not run on systems with older versions
          of gcc because of incompatible changes to the GCC and C run-time libraries. linux-x86-gcc43
          was built with gcc 4.3.0, and linux-x86_64-gcc42 was built with gcc 4.2.1. These
          builds will run on older Linux systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
