- Write to Swiss Light Source, Australian Synchrotron, LBL, 2BM to get their
  benchmarks for typical sizes:
  - Break out time for reading and writing compared to reconstruction
  - Typical sizes, range that they use.
  - Cost of their reconstruction cluster or computer

- Add ring artifact reduction to sinogram

- Make C simple application that reconstructs a .raw dataset with chunking

- Make debug file be a TomoParams parameter

- Allow different center for each slice.  Only re-do if the center has changed.

- Make tomoRecon object able to stay around to process more data with the same parameters
  - abort() aborts the current job
  - Constructor only takes tomoParms
  - compute() takes input and output pointers
