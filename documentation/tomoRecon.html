    This page is the home of tomoRecon, which is software for performing parallel beam
    tomography reconstruction using multiple threads. It uses the <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics">
      EPICS libCom</a> library for operating system independent support for threads,
    mutexes, message queues, etc. It uses a C++ version of the Gridrec software for
    the actual reconstruction. The library is provided in both source code form, and
    as 64-bit shareable libraries for Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX. The shareable libraries
    can be called from C++, IDL, GDL, or other languages.</p>

  <h2>
    Installation and Building</h2>
  <p>
    If using the source code distribution, it must be installed and built for use at
    your site. These steps only need to be performed once for the site (unless versions
    of the module running under different releases of EPICS and/or the other required
    modules are needed).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create an installation directory for the module, usually this will end with<br />
      <br />
      <tt>.../support/</tt>
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Place the distribution file in this directory. Then issue the commands (Unix style)
      <pre>gunzip measCompRX-Y.tgz
tar xvf tomoReconRX-Y.tar
</pre>
      where X-Y is the release.</li>
    <li>This creates a &lt;top&gt; application.<br />
      <pre>.../support/tomoReconRX-Y
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Edit the <tt>configure/RELEASE</tt> file and set the paths to your installation
      of EPICS base.</li>
    <li>Run <tt>gnumake</tt> in the top level directory and check for any compilation
      errors.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    IDL and GDL can be used as the "front-end" to tomoRecon, with IDL or GDL reading
    and writing the files and displaying images. The <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/IDL/tomography.html">
      GSECARS IDL tomography software</a> contains a file called tomo_recon.pro that
    calls the tomoRecon shareable library. The <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/IDL/tomography_routines.html#TOMO_RECON">
      documentation for tomo_recon</a> explains how to use these IDL routines. The tomo_recon
    routines are also included in this tomoRecon package.</p>
  <p>
    To use tomoRecon from IDL or GDL with tomo_recon.pro, the shareable library needs
    to be found. This can be done in two different ways.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Define the environment variable TOMO_RECON_SHARE to point to the shareable library.
      For example on the Linux bash shell "export TOMO_RECON_SHARE=/usr/local/lib/libtomoRecon.so".
      On Windows this might be "set TOMO_RECON_SHARE=C:\tomoRecon\tomoRecon.dll".</li>
    <li>If the environment variables does not exist, then it looks for the shareable library
      in the IDL "path", and the shareable library must be named: 'tomoRecon_' + !version.os
      + '_' + !version.arch + '.so' or '.dll' For example, tomoRecon_Win32_x86_64.dll
      or tomoRecon_linux_x86_64.so. This can be done either by renaming the shareable
      library or by using soft-links to the actual shareable library file.</li>
  </ol>
